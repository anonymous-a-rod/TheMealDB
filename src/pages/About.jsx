        <p className="mb-4">Welcome to our meals database created in React with Tailwind CSS. Our team, 
        led by Aaron Venema and consisting of Kelsey Jackson, Kamil Watson, Alex Hessler, Michael Plantamura, and Cliffton James, 
        has worked hard to develop this project during our time in the Mimo Bootcamp.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Our goal was to create a user-friendly database where users can easily search for
         meals and recipes using the Meals API. We used a combination of React, Tailwind CSS, and other tools and skills 
         we learned in the Mimo Bootcamp to build a sleek and modern user interface.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Thank you for using our meals database! We hope it helps you find some delicious recipes to try out.</p>
